# THREE.js-TYPESCRIPT-STARTER

## Why did I create this?

Well, Three.js has a lot of boilerplate to get even a basic project up and running.
I was spending a lot of time just setting up the same scene, camera, orbitcontrols
therefore I decided to make a super basic minimal template to save me time and serve as good practice.

This was heavily inspired by this book [Discover Three.js](https://discoverthreejs.com/)
which was one of the main resources I used to learn the basics of three.js.

## Starting Scene that you will get

## How to use this?

1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

and viola you have a working example

## Is this perfect?

Well, nothing is perfect but I still need to decide on which best practices to use.
Currently I am using Clock.getDelta() but I have been warned to not use it
I will update it once i've learned the best practices.
